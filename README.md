# Payment Calculator WPF
This is a C#.NET loan amoritzation calculator with a WPF UI.

## Features
This project also contains the VoidType financial library, which is a replacement of the VB.NET Financial library that uses the decimal types for greater accuracy. There are overloads for double types to remain backward compatible.
Once compiled it should be a single, portable 750KB exe file.

## Comments
This application was created with the skills I gained in college. The idea came from a VB class assignment.
The financial library was built from some research on the web and my own experience in finance class.
Feel free to port this application or pass it around as per the license.
I can't guarantee that it is bug-free, but it has been accurate in my test cases. If you find a bug, feel free to report it and I'll try to fix it. Unit tests may come in the future.
