## Comments
This application was created with the skills I gained in college. The idea came from a VB class assignment.
The financial library was built from some research on the web and my own experience in finance class. The variables are namedto match those used in the VB.NET Financial API.
Feel free to port this application or pass it around as per the GNU GPL. I am open to license changes if this hinders someone's use of this code.
I can't guarantee that it is bug-free, but it has been accurate in my test cases.
If you find a bug, feel free to report it and I'll try to fix it.
